# v0.10 Production Default (Option 2)

This package standardizes the production-default execution path around:

- relaxed meta-controller fallback (`configs/meta_controller_relaxed.yaml`)
- contract cache reuse (`reports/contracts_cache`)
- contract-only evaluation artifacts

## Canonical command (local CSV)

```bash
make run_morl_policy_quick \
  DATA_CONFIG=configs/data_local_gatra_prd_c335.yaml \
  META_CONFIG=configs/meta_controller_relaxed.yaml \
  CONTRACT_CACHE_ROOT=reports/contracts_cache
```

This command is the default recommended path for local end-to-end evaluation.

## Strict override

If you need strict constraints without relaxed fallback:

```bash
make run_morl_policy_quick \
  DATA_CONFIG=configs/data_local_gatra_prd_c335.yaml \
  META_CONFIG=configs/meta_controller.yaml
```

## What to inspect when fallback triggers

Under `reports/runs/<run_id>/eval/morl/`:

- `meta_selection.json`
- `meta_feasibility.json`
- `morl_selected_test.json`

These provide the audit trail for infeasible constraints, relax schedule use, and
final selected weights/metrics.

## Operational note: single-class TEST warnings

For some splits, TEST may contain one class only. In that case, sklearn can report
undefined ROC/PR-related warnings. This is expected for small windows or strict
label-delay policies and does not indicate a pipeline crash. For operational
decisions, prioritize budget-constrained policy outputs and objective summaries.
